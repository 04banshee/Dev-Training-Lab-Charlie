# Dev Lab CHARLIE/486 Story Card 

## User Story (Story Points = medüëï) 

**As a** user of a NodeJs application.

**I want** to interact and respond to the NodeJs app by providing input and have the appliction respond to user input. 

**So That** the application is dynamic and interactive [like this one](https://dev-training-lab-charlie.herokuapp.com/) to the end user.

## Comments/Discussion
#### AngularJs Background
- AngularJs is ideal for creating dynamic web applications.  To better understand Angular [click here](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/introduction) and check out what it has to offer.
- Angular uses `end points` to bind information to `call back`functions.  The data in the `end points` bind to a call back function and displays to a web browser .  Below is an example of this in `action`.

```AngularJs
 $http.get('/user')
      .then(response => {
          console.log(response.data);
          $scope.user = response.data;
       });
```
The `end point` in the example is /user.  Angular uses the data from the "user" file, which is a .json file.  AngularJs binds the contents of the file to the `call back` function and displays the data **asynchronously** to the web browser.  A input bock can be included so a user can dynamicly interact with the app.  [See it in action](https://dev-training-lab-charlie.herokuapp.com/) here.  Instead of sending the entirer webpage back to the server `AngularJs` is only sending the input the user types.

-  Angular uses JSON files to read data from. If you are unfamiliar with JSON file format [check out this out](https://docs.fileformat.com/web/json/).
-  To aid in Angular development the Chrome web browser has an web extension for [checking](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc) JSON files.
